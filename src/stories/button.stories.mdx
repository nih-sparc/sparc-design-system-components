## About Buttons
Buttons are a vital element in creating a positive and productive user experience. At their most basic, UX buttons are styled links that grab the user’s attention and help drive them in a particular direction. Buttons can link us to other pages or complete an action like “Browse Datasets.” They are often used as calls to actions (CTA) we want our users to complete on our website.

### Primary Button
This button is used for a primary call to action

<Story name='Primary' height='60px'>{stories.Primary()}</Story>

#### Code

```html
<el-button>Submit</el-button>
<el-button disabled>Disabled Button</el-button>
<el-button class="large">Large Button</el-button>
<el-button>Medium Button</el-button>
<el-button class="small">Small Button</el-button>
```

### Secondary Button
This button is used for a non-primary call to action that still needs attention
<Story name='Secondary' height='50px'>{stories.Secondary()}</Story>

#### Code

```html
<el-button class="secondary">Submit</el-button>
<el-button class="secondary" disabled>Disabled Button</el-button>
```

### Secondary (alt) Button
This button is used for a non-primary call to action
